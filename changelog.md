# Changelog

## Current development version

Compatibility: **Eclipse Dataspace Connector v0.8.0**

**New Features**

* Dynamically building AAS access URLs using Reference Chains [Submodel x, Collection y, Element z], a concept from AAS
  the specification
* Accepting self-signed certificates now
  optional (`edc.dataplane.aas.acceptOwnSelfSignedCertificates`, `edc.dataplane.aas.acceptAllSelfSignedCertificates`)
* SubmodelElementList is now a model element inside the SelfDescription (AASv3 change)

* New extension: data-plane-aas
    * Provides custom AAS data source and data sink
    * Communicate with AAS over AASDataAddress (see above, reference chains)
    * Allow communication with AAS with self-signed TLS certificates (configurable)

**Bugfixes**

* Adding external AAS services with self-signed certificates using configuration value edc.aas.remoteAASLocation is now
  possible
* Unregistering an external AAS service no longer throws IllegalArgumentException
* DataTransfer with AAS DataSource no longer throws IOException: closed

**Miscellaneous**

* In the development version, HTTP Push data transfer to AAS services with self-signed certificates is possible
    * This is only for testing
    * Will be removed in release version
    * Only works if the provider "knows" the consumer AAS service
* EDC4AAS extension now uses EDC monitor directly instead of wrapping it with custom logger
* Since the AAS model parsing got more complex, it was extracted out of the AAS agent
* Added tests for self-signed certificate retriever

          acceptedContractOffers)
        * Provider data is sent to a specific client HTTP endpoint using a new authentication key for each transaction (
          derived from the agreementId)
    * Add functionality for manually
        * fetching a set of provider contractOffers for a provider asset,
        * negotiating a contract with a provider using a contractOffer, returning an agreementId or an error message,
        * getting data of a negotiated contract from a provider.

**Bugfixes**

**New Features**

* Custom AuthenticationRequestFilter
    * Requests to the extension are now intercepted by a request filter
    * Requests to all endpoints except `/api/selfDescription` require authentication
    * The authentication method is defined within the launcher's build file. In the example launcher, a mocked identity
      and access management service is used: `_org.eclipse.edc:iam-mock_`
    * Available authentication methods are defined by the EDC. For further information see the EDCs
      AuthenticationServices and AuthenticationRequestFilters.

* Configuration value "exposeSelfDescription"
    * Set to _False_ to not expose the extension's self-descriptions
    * Default value is _True_

* Handling of HTTP status code from AAS service
    * Incorrect return values were assumed on client side

    * Also, submodels with modified submodelElements were reloaded into the AssetIndex & ContractDefinitionStore
        * Contract agreements were no longer valid because of this
